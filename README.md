CMPP client sending SMS verified code
======

CMPP client forked from yangyifeng01/pycmpp. But I rewrite most of them.

smsvc is a module to:

- randint 0000-9999 as verified code
- a mobile get the same verified code in 3 min
- a mobile get at most only one sms in 1 min
- log in sqlite3db file

smsvcserver simply use tornado to privide above as a http api
